   Remarks:
        - Assumes that there are at most 64 different states in the resulting automata
        - Assumes that the predicate names have already been maped to integers, and it 
          requires the map as an argument in the constructor.
        - Predicate names in the RPQ must be enclosed in < > (e.g. <P2119>?/<P2515>).
